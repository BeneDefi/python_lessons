Basic Mathematical Operations â€” Code Walkthrough
This code demonstrates the evolution of a very basic Python mathmatical program designed to perform addition. The code goes through three versions, gradually improving in functionality and user interaction.

Summary

Each version adds two values together, but the way the values are handled becomes more dynamic and realistic as the versions progress:

Version One: Adds two hardcoded numbers.

Version Two: Accepts user input but doesn't properly handle data types (results in string concatenation).

Version Three: Fixes the above by converting input strings to numbers before performing the addition.
