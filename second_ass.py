#Question One

#Question Two

middle_word = secret_word[6:8]

last_seven = secret_word[8:15]

'''
To reverse a string:
I donâ€™t need to specify start or stop values leaving them blank tells Python to use the entire string.
I set the step to -1, which tells Python to go through the string from the end to the beginning.
So, the slicing [::-1] essentially says:
A step of -1 means "start from the end and move backwards."
Start at the end of the string and step backwards one character at a time until the beginning.

'''
The slicing format is generally written as "start:stop:step".
If you leave out start and stop, and only specify step as 2, it tells Python.
Go through the entire string, but pick every second character only.
So, using ::2:
Starts at the first character,
Skips the next one,
Takes the one after that,
Skips again, and so on.

#Question Three

first_word = secret_word[0:6]
first_word = first_word.upper()
print(first_word)

last_word = secret_word[6:15]
last_word = last_word.lower()
print(last_word)

combined_words = first_word + last_word
